<p>
In BlueGrid, <code>shape tools</code> are used to draw almost any type of 2D shapes that are usually used in construction blueprints, such as line, rectangle, polygon, spline, path, shapes with wholes in side...etc. 
</p>
<note>
<p>
Shapes belong to the Metric class; therefore, they can subscribe to materials.</p>
</note>

<tip>
<p>
While drawing shapes, <code>point snap</code> options should be turned on to achieve the best accuracy.

    A polyline is a connected sequence of line segments created as a single shape. A polyline has two or many vertices. In BlueGrid, drawing a polyline is to pick all the vertices of the polyline, in ordered sequence.
    </p>
    <step>
    Select the <code>Polyline tool</code> from the <code>shape tool set</code>.
    </step>

    Click left mouse button on the <code>Draw board</code> to pick the first vertex of the polyline. By picking the first vertex, there will an extra active vertex which is always move with the mouse cursor.
    </step>
    <step>
    Repeat the second step to pick the next vertex of the polyline, and so on.
    </step>
    <step>
    To finish drawing the polyline, right mouse click <code>draw board</code> to remove the active extra vertex and finish the polyline.

    </step>
</procedure>

## Path tool
<p>
A path in BlueGrid represents a sequence of connected lines, curves, and movements (empty distances). When drawing a path in BlueGrid, you continuously create path elements. These elements come in six types: Line, Quad Curve, Cubic Curve, Arc, Move, and Close. Adjacent path elements are linked together, with the last control point of the previous element serving as the first control point of the next one. To draw different path elements, switch to the corresponding path mode. You can do this either directly from the path mode choice box or by using convenient shortcut keys. Below, youâ€™ll find a table of the available path mode shortcuts:
</p>

| Shortcut Key       | Path mode/Action      | Draw                           | Path element         | Visible  |
|:-------------------|:----------------------|:-------------------------------|:---------------------|:---------|
| <code>0</code>     | <code>Move to</code>  | Pick one point                 | Empty distance       | NO       |
| <code>1</code>     | <code>Line to</code>  | Pick next point                | Line                 | Yes      |
| <code>2</code>     | <code>Quad to</code>  | Pick next two points           | Quad Curve           | Yes      |
| <code>3</code>     | <code>Cubic to</code> | Pick next three points         | Cubic                | Yes      |
| <code>4</code>     | <code>Arc to</code>   | Pick next two points           | Circle Arc           | Yes      |
| <code>5</code>     | <code>Close</code>    | Path closes to last move       | Line (to last Move)  | Yes      |
| <code>Space</code> | Cancel last segment   | Last active segment is removed |                      | Yes      | 


<note>
The first element of a path is always a Move element and is automatically created when the path is started.

    <procedure title="Move to the next point" id="move-to-next-point">
        <p>
            A <code>Move element</code> is not a visible element, it does not draw anything, it is used to move the start point of the next element to another point. Thus, it creates an empty distance between the last control point of a visible path element and the first control point of the next visible path element.
            Without a <code>Move element</code> the next path element will start from the last control point of the previous path element.

    </procedure>
    <step>
        To finish drawing the path, right mouse click <code>draw board</code> to remove the active extra vertex and finish the path.
    </step>



<tip>
With path tool, you can draw complex shapes with multiple segments such as line, skip (empty distance), quadratic segment, cubic segment, arc segment, and with zero or multiple wholes inside.
